# Chocolate Lab

Update: 18/05/22
* I attempted the MVP but I've yet to do the extension
* I had an error with entering values for the different chocolates in the Dataloader class
* * note to self, I forgot to add float: e.g. (float)9.99
* Once I figure out how to solve that, I will attempt the extension
